      <h3>I am an activist, mathematician and machine learning consultant.</h3>

<p>2021: I joined Yonsei University as a Postdoctoral Researcher.</p>

<!--- <p>Here is the course website for the class on <a href="mlseminar.html">Deep learning for science students</a></p>--->
  I have a PhD in Mathematics from Northwestern University, and worked as an Postdoctoral Associate at Florida State University working in Machine Learning from January 2018 until June 2019. I worked at NewSci Labs for two years since July 2019. There, I develop machine learning technologies using Google Cloud Platform with Pytorch. I use my analytic skills to optimize NewSci's ML products and create new algorithms to work with images. I have experience creating custom GANs and CNN. You can learn more at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-dolores/"> LinkedIn page.</a></p>
      
      <p>Chicago-based artist Justus Harris and I won first place at Adaption 2017 in the category “Art + Data”. Adaptation is an EU commission-funded competition and exhibit that highlights the potential of the “Internet of things”. We exhibited our work in Berlin, Germany. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190221224722/http://agile-iot.eu:80/adaptation/about.html">Adaptation</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126064736/http://agile-iot.eu/2017/07/24/adaptation-fountains/">Fountains</a></p>
