      <h3>I am an activist, mathematician and machine learning consultant.</h3>

<p>I have a PhD in Mathematics from Northwestern University, and worked as an Postdoctoral Associate at Florida State University working in Machine Learning. I’ve been working at NewSci Labs since 2019; there, I develop machine learning technologies using Google Cloud Platform with Pytorch. I use my analytic skills to optimize NewSci's ML products and create new algorithms to work with images. I have experience creating custom GANs and CNN. You can learn more at my  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-dolores/"> LinkedIn page.</a></p>
      

      <h3>Preprint:</h3>
      <p>While I was an undergrad I showed how to extend the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem to quaternionic analysis,
 the methods allowed us to prove a couple of Abel's theorems about convergence of (hyperholomorphic) series and to find a bigger
region of convergence than the standart sphere.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Convergence of Taylor Series of real normed division algebras</em>. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02878">link</a>.</li>
        
      </ul>



      <h3>ML projects:</h3>
      <p>2020 Data Jam for Newspaper Navigator library of congress.
      We chose a year in which a world tragedy happened and selected headlines related to that tragedy to train an algorithm into learning
      to create fake headlines using the style and prhases of that fixed year.
      The algorithm takes an user generated phrase negating the tragedy and completes it as if those tragedies didn't occur.
      <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F0FZfoS_cbi1C-vaaln-DtHW5m554z2a?usp=sharing"> Colab Notebook </a></p>

      <p>Consultation to the department of Geography at FSU: bimonthly meetings to discussing possible ML projects with geographical data. </p>
      <p> We trained GPT2 on math arxiv papers and created fake abstracts. They can cheat undergraduate students but no PhD students as the abstracts are gramatically correct but made no math sense.

      <h3>Activist projects:</h3>
      <p>I work with teams in Mexico searching for missing people. Usually in regions with no electricity or where people dont have the newest smartphone. Since they don't know how to program and they cannot afford buying GPU's we deal with accessability issues.</p>
      <p>
      I made a program that finds common phrases among pdf files to help researchers chase mills that create fake research papers.
      <a href="https://github.com/Rubiel1/ramo"> RAMO. </a></p>
      <p>Justus Harris and me won the Adaption competition in the category of art+data. Adaptation is an EU commission funded competition and exhibit highlighting the potential of the Internet of things.
      We exhibited our work in Berlin. <a href=http://agile-iot.eu/adaptation/about.html>Adaptation</a>, <a href=http://agile-iot.eu/2017/07/24/adaptation-fountains/>Fountains</a></p>
      <p>In 2012 I volunteered to organize an international cultural protest in Mexico. That means: I coordinated the creation of a book of indigenous poetry, 
    I gave advise about art expositions in Chicago, among other peaceful activities. 
      </p>
      <p>Volunteer at AccessibleNU. I helped a couple of students with a disability to catch up on their math courses.</p>

  <h3>Teaching/Tutoring:</h3>
  <p>Cotutor two undergraduate students on their Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program’s project at FSU analyzing Tropical Forest data.</p>
  <p>I tutored two students on the project "translation from the Urban dictionary". I help them webscrap the database of definitions, and I guided them to write a python script that given an input phrase substitutes the words by their definitions according to the urban dictionary.</p>
  <p>Taught Math 234 summer quarter 2015, Multivariable calculus at Northwestern University.</p>
<p> 2017: I coordinated a highschool chess team, our biggest achievement was at the 4th Annual Mid-Atlantic Grade Champioship:
<br>
First place in the category of teams 9th grade.
<br>
Second place in the category of teams 11/12th grade.
<br>
3th place individual performance for 9th grade.
<br>
5th place individual performance for 11/12th grade.

  <h2>Other projcts:</h2>
    


    <p>I participated on the project <a href=https://quartz-glistening-august.glitch.me/>"COMPUTING & THE ECONOMY IN THE ANTHROPOCENES" </a> by the artist Sara Milkes  as a result I have a card The Oracle Deck for Computing and the Economy in the anthropocenes: </p>

<h3>Pure math:</h3>

<p> I conjecture that <a href="https://github.com/Rubiel1/49">  49x2^n has always an odd digit. </a>

    <a href=Seminar.html> Associators, Formality and Invariants  </a>seminar.
 I have spent time learning about non-commutativity and analysis with <a href=http://variablecompleja.esfm.ipn.mx/ShapiroPub.html>Shapiro Fishman</a>, homotopy and categories with <a href=http://www.math.cinvestav.mx/en/lupercio_home >Lupercio  Lara</a>, and  Operads with (<a href=http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~tamarkin/ > Dmitry Tamarkin </a>). Naturally  I am intrigued by the theory of Drinfeld associators, so I organized a seminar called: 
 Associators, Formality and Invariants, where I talked about EK-quantization of lie bialgebras, Homotopy Gerstenhaber algebras and formality, among other topics.
    <br>
Here are some notes.

<br>(<a href="TaipeiRT.pdf">notes</a>)  from Licata's course: <a href="http://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/chengsj/winterschool_2013.htm">Braid group actions from representation theory</a>).
<br>
My own notes on <a href="MasseyProduct.pdf"> A infinity algebras</a> (I was told there was an associator involved...)
<br>
 My own notes on <a href="Operad-TQFT.pdf"> Genus-zero TQFTs and operads  </a> from the seminar on:  <a href="http://math.northwestern.edu/~theojf/RTinvariants/">Reshetikhin Turaev Invariants</a>.
