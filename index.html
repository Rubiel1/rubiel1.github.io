 <h4>Art/activism:</h4>
 Justus Harris and me won the Adaption competition in the category of art+data. Adaptation is an EU commission funded competition and exhibit highlighting the potential of the Internet of things.
We exhibited our work in Berlin. <a href=http://agile-iot.eu/adaptation/about.html>Adaptation</a>, <a href=http://agile-iot.eu/2017/07/24/adaptation-fountains/>Fountains</a>

I am volunteering with groups of people looking for their missing relatives in Mexico.

<br>
    A couple of years ago I volunteered to organize international cultural protest against killing of women in Mexico. That means: I coordinated the creation of a book of indigenous poetry, 
    I gave advise about art expositions in Chicago, among other peaceful activities. The only goal was to allow the mexican population to express their disconfort with the terrible situation.

<br>
Volunteer at AccessibleNU: I helped a couple of students with a disability to catch up on their math courses.
<br>
Volunteer at 7th Annual IACS Diversity Career Expo.


<h4>Teaching experience: </h4>
Math 234 summer quarter, Multivariable calculus.
<br>
I coordinated a highschool chess team, our biggest achievement was at the 4th Annual Mid-Atlantic Grade Champioship:

First place in the category of teams 9th grade.

Second place in the category of teams 11/12th grade.

3th place individual performance for 9th grade.

5th place individual performance for 11/12th grade.


<h4>Computer Science:</h4>
I am familiar with algorithm theory.
    <br>
I can code in C,C+ and basic assembly language.  

<h4>Data Science</h4> 
Data analyst for the project <a href="http://makingacriminal.com/">Making a criminal.</a>  (Tested on Google Chrome).
I showed that while deportations have decreased, federal criminal prosecutions of immigrants across the U.S. have steadily increased. 
    <br>
Regular at <a href="https://chihacknight.org/">Chi Hacknight  </a> Chicago's weekly hackathon.
    <br>
Attended courses on: Desing and analysis of experiments, and Analysis of algorithms, Machine learning (currently auditing).
    <br>
SAS Certificates:<a href="Cert(4).pdf">SAS  essentials  </a>, <a href="SASSQL.pdf">SQL  essentials  </a>,   <a href="CertificateStat.pdf">Introduction to Statistical Concepts</a>, <a href="CertificateSASstatistics.pdf">Introduction to Anova, regression and logistic regression</a>.

<h4>Research Interest:</h4>
Operads, Drinfeld associators, homological algebra, category theory.
    <br>
    <br>
I worked with Dmitry Tamarkin on DG operads. 
<br> <br>
    Preprint: <a href="draftregions.pdf"> On regions of convergence of hyperholomorphic functions".</a>
While I was an undergrad I showed how to extend the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem to quaternionic analysis,
 the methods allowed us to prove a couple of Abel's theorems about convergence of (hyperholomorphic) series 
Here is the complete <a href=http://tesis.ipn.mx/jspui/handle/123456789/10933>thesis in Spanish</a>. 
<br><br>
    <a href=Seminar.html> Associators, Formality and Invariants  </a>seminar.
 I have spent time learning about non-commutativity and analysis with <a href=http://variablecompleja.esfm.ipn.mx/ShapiroPub.html>Shapiro Fishman</a>, homotopy and categories with <a href=http://www.math.cinvestav.mx/en/lupercio_home >Lupercio  Lara</a>, and  Operads with (<a href=http://www.math.northwestern.edu/~tamarkin/ > Dmitry Tamarkin </a>). Naturally  I am intrigued by the theory of Drinfeld associators, so I organized a seminar called: 
 Associators, Formality and Invariants, where I talked about EK-quantization of lie bialgebras, Homotopy Gerstenhaber algebras and formality, among other topics.
    <br>
Here are some notes.

<br>(<a href="TaipeiRT.pdf">notes</a>)  from Licata's course: <a href="http://www.math.sinica.edu.tw/chengsj/winterschool_2013.htm">Braid group actions from representation theory</a>).
<br>
My own notes on <a href="MasseyProduct.pdf"> A infinity algebras</a> (I was told there was an associator involved...)
<br>
 My own notes on <a href="Operad-TQFT.pdf"> Genus-zero TQFTs and operads  </a> from the seminar on:  <a href="http://math.northwestern.edu/~theojf/RTinvariants/">Reshetikhin Turaev Invariants</a>.
