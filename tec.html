      <p>The notebook archive.  Computing Order Series/Ehrhart Polynomials of posets with Mathematica. I explain how to find Ehrhart series of non series parallel posets with Mathematica <a href="https://notebookarchive.org/computing-order-series-ehrhart-polynomials-of-posets-with-mathematica--2022-02-3pvm73a/">In this mathematica notebook.</a>
      If you want to find the Ehrhart series of a series parallel poset, you can probably do it by hand using few rules (explained at the end of the notebook).

      We chose headlines related to tragedies that occurred in 1910 and selected headlines related to those tragedies to train an algorithm into learning to create fake headlines using the style and phrasing of that fixed year. The algorithm takes a user-generated phrase negating the tragedy and completes it as if those tragedies didn't occur.

  <p> Trained GPT2 in math arxiv papers and created fake abstracts. The algorithm can create abstracts that  undergraduate students cannot recognize as fake but cannot convince PhD students, as the abstracts are grammatically correct but made no mathematical sense.

    <p>I participated in the project "<a href=https://quartz-glistening-august.glitch.me/>COMPUTING & THE ECONOMY IN THE ANTHROPOCENES</a>" by the Georgia-based artist Sara Milkes; I have a card in the “The Oracle Deck for Computing and the Economy in the Anthropocenes”, shown below. </p>

    <p>Chicago-based artist Justus Harris and I won first place at Adaption 2017 in the category “Art + Data”. Adaptation is an EU commission-funded competition and exhibit that highlights the potential of the “Internet of things”. We exhibited our work in Berlin, Germany.</p> I coded in Maya/Blender modifications to 3d scans of people. We simulated the diseasses caused by their local water pollutants.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190221224722/http://agile-iot.eu:80/adaptation/about.html">Adaptation</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126064736/http://agile-iot.eu/2017/07/24/adaptation-fountains/">Fountains</a></p>
