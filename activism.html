      <h3>Activism:</h3>
      <p>I collaborated with Awful-AI, a curated list to track current scary usages of AI - hoping to raise awareness to its misuses in society <a href="https://github.com/daviddao/awful-ai"> Awful AI</a></p>
      <p>I’ve been working with teams in Mexico that search for missing people since 2014. Usually we search for missing people who lived in or were near regions with no electricity or the latest technology. Since members of the team in Mexico don't know how to program and they cannot afford buying GPU's, I look for solutions for these accessibility issues.</p>
      <p>
      Roberto Maldonado and I created a program that finds common phrases within pdf files to help researchers chase mills that create fake research papers. 
      <a href="https://github.com/Rubiel1/ramo"> RAMO. </a></p>
      <p>Chicago-based artist Justus Harris and I won first place at Adaption 2017 in the category “Art + Data”. Adaptation is an EU commission-funded competition and exhibit that highlights the potential of the “Internet of things”. We exhibited our work in Berlin, Germany.<a href=http://agile-iot.eu/adaptation/about.html>Adaptation</a>, <a href=http://agile-iot.eu/2017/07/24/adaptation-fountains/>Fountains</a></p>
      <p>In 2012, I volunteered to organize an international cultural protest in Mexico; there, I coordinated the creation of  <a href="http://goo.gl/SfaIKc"> a book about indigenous poetry </a> and gave advise about art expositions in Chicago, among other peaceful activities.

      <p>Volunteer at AccessibleNU. I helped a couple of students with disabilities catch up on their math courses.</p>
