<p>An exploration of the ways that artists are taking up new AI image generation tools and pushing the boundaries of what can be done with them. Using the starting theme of human bodies and health, filtered through the perspective of machine creation, the exhibition interrogates both the hopes and fears related to machine learning technologies including humanity’s existential crisis. Many of the images are related to representations of non-normative human health conditions: failing vision, the feeling of having diabetes, bodies that require prosthetics like wheelchairs, and even mental struggles like depression. These topics were chosen to test the possibilities and boundaries of representation through the aggregate databases that have trained these algorithms; yet, in addition to the politics of representation, the outputted images also reference issues of copyright, cultural appropriation, corporate control of media, and erasures of context and history.

This project is a unique collaboration between the Graduate School of Communication & Arts and the Faculty of Mathematics and Computation, bringing together researchers across the arts and sciences at various levels in their careers, from Postdoctoral researchers to graduate and undergraduate students.
